# A changed user data does not replace a running control-plane node. The runs
# share one state and run in order. Every run is an apply, because the payload
# carries a generated token and is unknown at plan.
#
# How a run tells a kept node from a replaced one: the instance ignores changes
# to user_data_base64, so a kept node keeps the user data it was created with.
# connectivity_user_data_base64 is the new render for the first node.
#
# What a mock cannot show:
# - The mock gives an instance the same id each time it creates one, so an id
#   does not show a replacement.
# - The real EC2 API is not called, so these runs do not prove that AWS keeps
#   the node running, or what cloud-init does on a replaced node.
# They show what OpenTofu stores for the module's own resources.
