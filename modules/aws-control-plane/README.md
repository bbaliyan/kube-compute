# aws-control-plane

Provisions the AWS control plane for an RKE2 cluster: its control-plane node(s) plus the
cluster-wide resources. It consumes `node-bootstrap` for per-cluster identity, join
tokens, and GitOps bootstrap. A control plane with `control_plane_count = 1` is a complete
single-node cluster.

## Boot flow: pre-baked AMI + lean cloud-init, no live connection

This module runs **no live Ansible** at `apply` time. It renders `node-bootstrap`'s
`#cloud-config` payload (node identity, join tokens, registries/CA, GitOps Application
manifests — see `modules/node-bootstrap/README.md`) and attaches it as
`user_data_base64`. Nothing in this module connects to the node, waits on it, or observes
it converge. `apply` returns as soon as the instance and its user-data exist.

The heavy half of RKE2 bootstrap (binaries, SELinux policy, kernel modules) is expected to
already be baked into the AMI, via `kube-images`' `kube-node/packer/aws/`
template. You must pass a kube-images-baked AMI with `os_image_ami_id`, or its name with
`os_image_name`. If you pass neither, the plan fails. A stock image has no RKE2, so a node
booted from it would never join. With `os_image_name`, the module resolves the ID itself
via a data lookup scoped to your own account and the derived architecture. A pattern with
the build date omitted (using EC2's `*`/`?` wildcards) resolves to the most recent
matching build. This mirrors `proxmox-control-plane`'s `proxmox_template_vm_id`.

### Keeping user data under EC2's limit

EC2 rejects `RunInstances` when decoded user data exceeds 16384 bytes. Static content therefore stays out of the payload. The genesis node reads the Cilium and Argo CD manifests from a clone of the platform ref. With `trusted_ca_in_image`, a CA is baked into the image. The bootstrap program travels in the payload
with its comments removed. A precondition on the instance names the levers when the
limit is exceeded.

### A change to the user data of a running node

A change to any input in the user data, such as a Helm parameter of the platform
Application, does not touch a running node. The instance ignores the change and keeps
the user data it booted with. cloud-init reads user data only at the first boot, so
the node would not apply the change anyway.

To apply a change, replace the node on purpose. The replaced node boots with the
current user data.

The addresses are:

- First node: `module.<name>.aws_instance.control_plane["0"]`
- Other nodes: `module.<name>.aws_instance.control_plane["1"]`

Inside `aws-cluster`, put `module.<name>.module.control_plane.` before the resource
type instead.

> **Warning:** Replacing a single-node cluster loses the cluster.

1. If the cluster has one node, stop. Replacing it loses the cluster.
2. Select a node. Replace the additional nodes first, one at a time. Start with key `"1"`.
3. Drain the node: `kubectl drain <node> --ignore-daemonsets --delete-emptydir-data`.
4. Delete the Kubernetes node: `kubectl delete node <node>`.
5. Replace the instance: `tofu apply -replace='<address>'`.
6. Verify that the node is `Ready`: `kubectl get nodes`.
7. Verify that every etcd pod is `Running`: `kubectl -n kube-system get pods -l component=etcd`.
8. If another additional node needs the change, go back to step 2.

> **Warning:** Replace the first node last, in its own apply.

9. Do steps 3 to 7 for the first node.

Do not replace several nodes in one apply: etcd loses its quorum.

## Scope

The module provisions the **node and only what is intrinsic to it**. That is the EC2
instance, its own security group, its IAM role/instance-profile, and (optionally) a DNS
record. It **never creates network fabric** (VPC, subnet, internet gateway, NAT, route
tables). You plug in existing networking, or it falls back to the account's default VPC.

## Topology

- **`control_plane_count`** — `1` (default), `3`, or `5`. `2` and `4` are rejected (no
  fault-tolerance benefit, split-brain risk). `3`/`5` place one control-plane node per
  availability zone behind an internal NLB on 6443. They require `control_plane_subnets`,
  a map of AZ -> subnet id spanning at least 3 distinct AZs. Fewer than 3 AZs fails the
  plan with a clear error. `registration_address` becomes the NLB's DNS name. The first
  control-plane node probes that address at boot. If it is reachable, the node joins the
  existing quorum. If not, it initializes. RKE2 has no `--cluster-init` flag. The first
  server is simply the one whose config omits a `server:` join address. So replacing it is
  always a safe rejoin, never a second initialization.
- **`cluster_type`** — `all_in_one` (default; control-plane node stays schedulable) or
  `dedicated_control_plane` (tainted `CriticalAddonsOnly=true:NoExecute`; for use once
  node pools exist). Derived from this explicit intent, never from node counts — node
  pools are separate Terraform state this module cannot see.
- **Datastore** — always embedded etcd (RKE2's only supported datastore), including for
  `control_plane_count = 1`, for one consistent datastore and uniform snapshots.


## Networking

Three ways to specify the subnet (pick one):

- **`subnet_id`** — pass the literal subnet ID to launch into your own subnet.
- **`subnet_name`** — pass the Name tag; the module resolves the ID via a data lookup. Pair with
  `vpc_name` to scope the search when the tag is not globally unique.
- **Neither** — the module falls back to a subnet in the account's **default VPC** (data lookup;
  it never *creates* a VPC). Accounts whose default VPC was deleted must pass a subnet.

## DNS (optional)

DNS is a convenience, not a hard dependency:

- Set `cluster_domain` to get a named FQDN (`api.<cluster>.<domain>`) and a wildcard
  (`*.<cluster>.<domain>`). Omit it and the node is reachable by IP only.
- Additionally set `hosted_zone_id` to have the module create the wildcard A record in
  that Route53 zone.
- If you don't pass `hosted_zone_id`, the module creates **no** DNS record. Register the
  `wildcard_dns_name` output at the `cluster_ip` in whatever DNS you run (Route53, a local
  resolver, RFC2136, external-dns, or an `sslip.io`-style fallback).

## Access

Zero inbound beyond `ingress_ports` (default 80/443/6443) from `allowed_ingress_cidrs`; no SSH.
IMDSv2 is enforced. Operator access to the node is via AWS SSM (the IAM role attaches
`AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore`) — there is no inbound shell port.

## Join flow (workers and, later, additional control-plane nodes)

This module generates its own join tokens directly (`random_password.server_token` /
`random_password.agent_token`), matching `proxmox-control-plane`'s precedent. Two tokens
are never exposed as raw values outside the module. `cluster_token` is the **server
token**, used by both genesis and every `server-join` node. `cluster_agent_token` is the
**agent token**, mirrored into an SSM `SecureString` that workers fetch via their own
instance IAM role. Workers receive only the agent token, so a compromised worker cannot
rejoin as control-plane/etcd.

One security group carries east-west traffic: `aws_security_group.cluster` (self-referencing,
every member, exposed as `cluster_security_group_id` for an `aws-node-pool` unit to attach
to by id). It admits all traffic among members, workers included, so etcd (2379-2380) is not
limited to control-plane nodes. `registration_address` is what a joining node's
`--server` flag targets — for `control_plane_count = 1` this is the control-plane node's private
IP.

## HA control plane (`control_plane_count` > 1)

`control_plane_subnets` (a map of AZ -> subnet id) is required once `control_plane_count > 1` —
the module does not auto-discover multi-AZ subnets. Its keys ARE the AZs, so a caller cannot
accidentally supply two subnets in the same AZ. Pass at least 3 entries spanning at least 3
distinct AZs; fewer fails plan explicitly rather than silently forming a weaker quorum.

Once `control_plane_count > 1`, the single `subnet_id`/`subnet_name` above is unused for
control-plane placement. The module's own VPC (for its security groups and the NLB target
group) is derived from `control_plane_subnets` itself. So it can never disagree with where
the instances actually launch.

The genesis node is unchanged in shape from `control_plane_count = 1`. Additional
control-plane nodes (`server-join`) bootstrap concurrently with it and join via the NLB.
They retry the registration endpoint the same way a worker retries its join target.
node-bootstrap's own staggered, self-healing retry handles the one genuine etcd constraint
(one non-voting learner at a time) among the joining siblings. Argo/platform GitOps inputs
are only ever passed to the genesis node, so platform bootstrap manifests never race on
more than one server.

## Cilium and Argo CD manifests

The genesis node clones the platform ref (`gitops_platform_repo_url` at `gitops_platform_revision`) before RKE2 starts. It takes `bootstrap/rendered/cilium.yaml` and `bootstrap/rendered/argocd.yaml` from the clone. The AMI holds neither. The AMI must hold git. See [`node-bootstrap`](../node-bootstrap/README.md).

## Container Network Interface (CNI)

The CNI is always Cilium. The Canal variant does not work on AlmaLinux 10, this project's only supported OS: its kernel dropped the legacy `br_netfilter`, `xt_conntrack` and `xt_comment` modules. The Cilium manifest from the platform ref sets the operator to `1` replica (chart default `2`) on every topology. So a single-node cluster has no `Pending` replica. The cluster security group's
self-referencing all-protocol rule already covers the CNI traffic.

## Registration endpoint modes (`endpoint_mode`)

Only relevant once `control_plane_count > 1` — a single control-plane node has no registration
endpoint at all.

- **`loadbalancer`** (default) — an internal NLB across all control-plane nodes on
  6443.
- **`dns`** — one Route53 A record per control-plane node under a shared name
  (`cp.<cluster_name>.<cluster_domain>`), with multivalue-answer routing. Each record is
  backed by a `CLOUDWATCH_METRIC` health check on that instance's own EC2 status-check
  alarm. Route53's public health checkers can't reach a private VPC IP directly, so the
  alarm is the bridge. Requires `cluster_domain` and a resolvable hosted zone. Cheaper
  than an NLB; failover is TTL-bound (`ttl = 10`), not instant.
- **`static`** — creates no load balancer or DNS record; `static_registration_address`
  is used verbatim. For a consumer that already runs its own front end.

## Input notes

See the generated tables below. Environment-specific values are inputs — none are baked in. Compute sizing
is AWS-native: `instance_type` (bundles vCPU+memory), `root_volume_size_gb`, `root_volume_type`.
`os_image_ami_id` or `os_image_name` is required (see "Boot flow"). Join tokens and the cluster security group are **not** inputs — this
module generates and owns them directly (see "Join flow").

## Outputs for workers

`registration_address` is a node's private IP for `control_plane_count = 1`. Otherwise `endpoint_mode`
shapes it. `control_plane_node_refs` lists every control-plane node, not just the first.
An `aws-node-pool` unit reads `cluster_security_group_id` and `agent_token_ssm_parameter` through a
`dependency "control_plane"` block. It attaches workers to the cluster security group and fetches the
agent token. Raw join token values are never outputs. Workers only need the SSM parameter name.

## Out of scope (lives in the consumer repo)

Team-specific operational policy is **not** in this module — e.g. a schedule that stops and
starts the nodes. `aws-cluster` has one, `power_schedule`. Used on its own, this module needs an
`aws_scheduler_schedule` in your own config referencing the `instance_id` output.

This module's own instances attach to it by id; an aws-node-pool unit depends on this module to attach its workers the same way. |
| <a name="output_connectivity_user_data_base64"></a> [connectivity\_user\_data\_base64](#output\_connectivity\_user\_data\_base64) | base64gzip of the genesis node's user data. Exposed for tests and debugging. |
| <a name="output_control_plane_node_refs"></a> [control\_plane\_node\_refs](#output\_control\_plane\_node\_refs) | Map of control-plane node name -> {instance\_id, provider}. The control-plane abstraction (SSM send-command today) targets every node from this map instead of a single node\_control\_ref. |
| <a name="output_effective_ami_id"></a> [effective\_ami\_id](#output\_effective\_ami\_id) | AMI ID used (os\_image\_ami\_id, or the os\_image\_name lookup). |
| <a name="output_hosted_zone_id"></a> [hosted\_zone\_id](#output\_hosted\_zone\_id) | Route53 zone the cluster's records live in, resolved from hosted\_zone\_id or hosted\_zone\_name. Null when no domain is configured. |
| <a name="output_instance_id"></a> [instance\_id](#output\_instance\_id) | Provider-native node ID. |
| <a name="output_node_arch"></a> [node\_arch](#output\_node\_arch) | CPU architecture reported by AWS for the instance type (arm64 or x86\_64). |
| <a name="output_node_control_ref"></a> [node\_control\_ref](#output\_node\_control\_ref) | Handle the control-plane verb-scripts use to reach the node out-of-band (kubeconfig fetch, break-glass shell). For AWS: the instance ID, targeted via 'aws ssm send-command'/'aws ssm start-session' in region aws\_region. |
| <a name="output_node_iam_role_name"></a> [node\_iam\_role\_name](#output\_node\_iam\_role\_name) | IAM role name attached to the node. Reference this in your consumer repo to attach additional policies (e.g. SSM Parameter Store read access for ESO). |
| <a name="output_node_provider"></a> [node\_provider](#output\_node\_provider) | Provider identifier the control-plane verb-scripts use to dispatch (AWS = SSM). |
| <a name="output_node_security_group_id"></a> [node\_security\_group\_id](#output\_node\_security\_group\_id) | Security group carrying this cluster's external ingress\_ports rules. A worker that takes over the ingress controller needs it, or the ports stay open on a node no longer serving them. Distinct from cluster\_security\_group\_id, which is east-west only. |
| <a name="output_registration_address"></a> [registration\_address](#output\_registration\_address) | Address workers and joining servers use to reach the cluster API. With one control-plane node, its private IP. Otherwise it depends on endpoint\_mode: the NLB DNS name, the Route53 record name, or static\_registration\_address. |
| <a name="output_subnet_id"></a> [subnet\_id](#output\_subnet\_id) | Subnet ID the genesis node launched into; the first control-plane AZ slot when control\_plane\_count > 1, and identical to the single-node resolution below that. Consumed by aws-static-node so a worker inherits the control plane's availability zone. |
| <a name="output_vpc_id"></a> [vpc\_id](#output\_vpc\_id) | VPC ID the control plane launched into (derived from the subnet — the single-node subnet\_id/subnet\_name/default-VPC fallback for control\_plane\_count = 1, or the control-plane subnets themselves for control\_plane\_count > 1). |
| <a name="output_wildcard_dns_name"></a> [wildcard\_dns\_name](#output\_wildcard\_dns\_name) | Wildcard hostname for cluster services (e.g. *.example.example.internal), or null when no cluster\_domain was given. Point this at cluster\_ip in your DNS of choice. |

## Testing

    cd modules/aws-control-plane
    tofu init -backend=false && tofu test   # offline — mock_provider "aws", no credentials

Real `plan`/`apply` against AWS is run by the operator from a consumer repo.
